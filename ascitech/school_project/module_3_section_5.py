# Python, however, has its own sorting mechanisms. No one needs to write their own sorts, as there is a sufficient number of ready-to-use tools.
# We explained this sorting system to you because it's important to learn how to process a list's contents, and to show you how real sorting may work.

# You can use the sort() method to sort elements of a list, e.g.:
this_list = [32,54,77,4,88,9,1]
this_list.sort()        # the method named sort, can be used to sort a list 
print("Sorted list      ",this_list)

#  There is also a list method called reverse(), which you can use to reverse the list, e.g.:
this_list.reverse()  # It is reversed in a sorted way
print("The reversed list",this_list)

# Skills for all 
# Some convention in python


print(1_5 + 2_5) # I never new that this also works
print(15 + 25)  # It is actually the same 

# When we put 0O its a Octal number in python
print(0o123)  # This is an Octal number which equals to 83
a = 0O123
print(type(a)) # Integer but Octal number

# The second convention allows us to use hexadecimal numbers. 
# Such numbers should be preceded by the prefix 0x or 0X (zero-x).

# 0x123 is a hexadecimal number with a (decimal) value equal to 291. 
# The print() function can manage these values too. Try this:

print(0x123)  # 0x Zero and x infront of the number makes it a hexadecimal number

# When you want to use any numbers that are very large or very small, you can use scientific notation
print(3E8)  # This is a scientifc notation for 3*10**8 or 3 times 10 to the power of 8
print(5.3e4)
# the exponent (the value after the E) has to be an integer;
# the base (the value in front of the E) may be either an integer or a float.

# there are two escaped quotes inside the string â€’ can you see them both?
print("I like \"Python\" ")  #how to encode a quote inside a string which is already delimited by quotes.

#Second Method
print('I like "Python"')
print('I like \'Python\'!')

print('I\'m Mounty\' Pyhton')

# Boolean invented by George Boole
print(True > False)
print(True < False)


# Write a one-line piece of code, using the print() function, as well as the newline and escape characters, 
# to match the expected result outputted on three lines.
# "I'm "
# "" learning ""

print('\""learning\""')
print('\"""Python\"""')

print(10//2) # This returns an integer value or it a Integer Division
